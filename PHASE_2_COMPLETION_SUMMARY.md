- **Needs**: 10 more posts
- **Impact**: Medium - marketing/SEO

## Recommendation

### Priority 1: Verify Existing Content
Rather than rewriting, verify and update:
1. Check all guides for accuracy
2. Update dates and versions
3. Add performance metrics where relevant
4. Fix any broken links

### Priority 2: Create Missing Content
Focus on truly missing items:
1. New guides (benchmarking, testing, observability)
2. Remaining blog posts
3. Architecture updates

### Priority 3: Quality Polish
Final touches:
1. SEO optimization
2. Mobile responsiveness
3. Link validation
4. Community feedback

## Time Estimate

### Realistic Timeline
- **Verification & Updates**: 2-3 days
- **New Content**: 5-7 days
- **Quality Polish**: 2-3 days
- **Total**: 9-13 days

### vs Original Estimate
- **Original**: 4 weeks (28 days)
- **Actual Needed**: ~2 weeks (10-13 days)
- **Reason**: Most content already exists and is current

## Conclusion

The documentation is in **much better shape than initially assessed**. Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 is largely current (just needs verification and minor updates), and Phase 3 needs the most work (blog posts).

**Recommendation**: Shift focus to:
1. Quick verification pass on existing guides
2. Create truly missing content (new guides, blog posts)
3. Quality polish and SEO

This is more efficient than rewriting content that's already good.
